# DwarfHeim - Project Rebellion
A BepInEx and HarmonyX based hack that is hoping to restore minimum functionality to DwarfHeim after its API got shut down by the publisher.

As of now there is still a lot of work required, but a portion of a singleplayer should be now playable.

# Requirements
* The official copy of the game
* [BepInEx UnityMono x64 6.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/) and HarmonyX (bundled with the release)

# Installation
* Download [Sui's Hack](https://github.com/SuiMachine/DwarfHeim---Project-Rebellion/releases).
* Extract the zip archive and move it to the game's directory.
